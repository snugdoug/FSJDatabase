Essential Features (Minimum Viable Product):

    Data Types:  Handle various Java data types (int, String, boolean, double, Date/Time, etc.).  You'll need to serialize these to the files and deserialize them back.  Consider using a format like JSON for flexibility.  A JSON library like Jackson or Gson would be very helpful.

    CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete):
        Insert (Create): Already implemented. Make sure it handles different data types correctly.
        Select (Read): Implement methods to retrieve data based on different criteria (e.g., select * from users where id = 1, select name, age from users where age > 25). Support filtering, ordering, and limiting results.
        Update: Implement methods to modify existing data (e.g., update users set age = 31 where id = 1).
        Delete: Implement methods to remove data (e.g., delete from users where id = 1).

    Indexing (Optional but Recommended):  For larger datasets, indexing is crucial for performance.  Consider creating indexes on frequently queried columns (especially primary keys) to speed up lookups.  A simple in-memory index (e.g., a HashMap) could be a good start.

    Error Handling and Validation:  Add robust error handling (try-catch blocks) to handle IOExceptions, invalid data, and other potential problems.  Implement data validation (e.g., checking for required fields, data type validation) to ensure data integrity.

    Transactions (Basic Support):  For data consistency, even basic transaction support is important.  At a minimum, you could implement a simple "commit" and "rollback" mechanism.  This could involve writing changes to a temporary file first and then atomically renaming the file to the actual table file upon commit.

    Query Language (Simple):  Design a simple query language (or API) that users can use to interact with the database.  It doesn't have to be full SQL, but it should be expressive enough to perform common operations.  Consider something similar to a simplified SQL or a more object-oriented API.

Further Enhancements (For a More Complete Library):

    Schema Management:  Allow users to define the schema of their tables (column names, data types, constraints) programmatically or through a simple definition file.

    Data Serialization/Deserialization:  Implement efficient methods for reading and writing data to the files.  Consider using a binary format (in addition to JSON) for better performance and smaller file sizes.

    Concurrency Control:  Implement proper locking mechanisms to handle concurrent access to the database files.  This is essential for multi-threaded applications.

    Advanced Querying:  Support more complex queries, such as joins (if you want to support relationships between tables), aggregations (e.g., count, sum, avg), and subqueries.

    Data Import/Export:  Provide utilities to import data from CSV, JSON, or other formats, and export data to these formats.

    Configuration:  Allow users to configure the database (e.g., the location of the data files, indexing options) through a configuration file or programmatically.

Development Steps:

    Start with the Essentials: Focus on the core CRUD operations, data types, and basic error handling. This will give you a working foundation.
    Add Features Incrementally: Implement the remaining features one by one, testing thoroughly as you go.
    Write Unit Tests: Write unit tests for each feature to ensure that it works correctly and to prevent regressions as you add new features. JUnit is a good choice for unit testing in Java.
    Document Your Library: Write clear documentation on how to use your library. This is crucial for other developers to be able to use it effectively.
